# Movie Recommendations
Machine Learning project completed in 2021 during Bachelor's degree on a public Kaggle dataset containing IMBD Movies.
The goal is to use machine learning to create a recommendation system by first creating a 'bag of words' for each movie in the dataset and then creating similarities between these words and displaying the top 10 titles that have the highest similarities between these keywords. The 'bag of words' is composed of the genre, actors, directors and the description for each title. This is a basic content-based movie recommender. The recommender system takes as input and recommend movies from the top 250 rated movies according to IMDB. Recommendations are generated according to Genre, Directors, Main Actors and Plot.
